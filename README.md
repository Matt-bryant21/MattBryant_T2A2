## R1 Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building the app
The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) is not just a premier mixed martial arts organization; it's a billion-dollar empire that orchestrates the careers of over 500 fighters across 12 divisions. In this high-stakes arena, each fighter's record is a dynamic entity, susceptible to rapid changes through regular and almost weekly events. The problem at hand involves several intricate aspects:

* Dynamic Fighter Records: Fighter records in the UFC are constantly evolving. Each event can significantly alter a fighter's career trajectory, making it crucial to update records swiftly to reflect these changes accurately.

* High Fan Engagement and Expectations: The UFC's passionate fanbase demands up-to-date information. Fans actively engage in discussions and predictions about future matchups and championships, necessitating immediate updates to fighter records following events.

* Complex Data Management: The sheer volume of fighters and the frequency of events create a logistical challenge in maintaining accurate and current records. There's a need for a system that can efficiently manage the creation, updating, and deletion of these records in a centralised platform.

__The Solution: A Specialized Web Application for UFC Fighter Management__

The purpose of developing this web application is to address these specific problems by:

* Offering Real-Time Updates: The app will enable quick updates to fighter records, keeping pace with the rapid changes that occur in the UFC, thus maintaining data integrity.

* Enhancing User Interaction: By providing a clean and simple interface, the app allows users, ranging from fans to professionals, to interact with the latest fighter records easily.

* Facilitating Data Control and Security: Depending on their privileges, users can not only view but also modify fighter records. This includes adding new records, updating existing ones, and, where necessary, deleting them.

* By tackling these problems, the app aims to streamline the management of fighter records, cater to the high expectations of UFC fans, and enhance the operational efficiency of managing fighter data. 

## R2 Why is it a problem that needs solving? 
The world of mixed martial arts, particularly in organizations like the UFC, represents a vast and complex ecosystem. At its core, athlete management in such a high-profile sport is a colossal undertaking, encompassing a range of critical aspects:

* Volume of Athletes: With hundreds of fighters across multiple weight divisions, each with unique career trajectories, keeping track of every athlete's record, health status, contractual obligations, and ranking is a Herculean task.

* Dynamic Nature of Fighter Records: Fighter profiles are not static; they evolve with each bout. This includes updates in win-loss records, performance metrics, and medical suspensions. Accurate and real-time tracking of these changes is vital for the integrity of the sport.

* Fan Engagement and Transparency: Fans and analysts demand up-to-date information on fighter stats, upcoming bouts, and division rankings. Providing this information in a user-friendly manner enhances fan engagement and the sport's accessibility.
