## R1 Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building the app
The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) is not just a premier mixed martial arts organization; it's a billion-dollar empire that orchestrates the careers of over 500 fighters across 12 divisions. In this high-stakes arena, each fighter's record is a dynamic entity, susceptible to rapid changes through regular and almost weekly events. The problem at hand involves several intricate aspects:

* Dynamic Fighter Records: Fighter records in the UFC are constantly evolving. Each event can significantly alter a fighter's career trajectory, making it crucial to update records swiftly to reflect these changes accurately.

* High Fan Engagement and Expectations: The UFC's passionate fanbase demands up-to-date information. Fans actively engage in discussions and predictions about future matchups and championships, necessitating immediate updates to fighter records following events.

* Complex Data Management: The sheer volume of fighters and the frequency of events create a logistical challenge in maintaining accurate and current records. There's a need for a system that can efficiently manage the creation, updating, and deletion of these records in a centralised platform.

__The Solution: A Specialized Web Application for UFC Fighter Management__

The purpose of developing this web application is to address these specific problems by:

* Offering Real-Time Updates: The app will enable quick updates to fighter records, keeping pace with the rapid changes that occur in the UFC, thus maintaining data integrity.

* Enhancing User Interaction: By providing a clean and simple interface, the app allows users, ranging from fans to professionals, to interact with the latest fighter records easily.

* Facilitating Data Control and Security: Depending on their privileges, users can not only view but also modify fighter records. This includes adding new records, updating existing ones, and, where necessary, deleting them.

By tackling these problems, the app aims to streamline the management of fighter records, cater to the high expectations of UFC fans, and enhance the operational efficiency of managing fighter data. 

## R2 Why is it a problem that needs solving? 
The world of mixed martial arts, particularly in organizations like the UFC, represents a vast and complex ecosystem. At its core, athlete management in such a high-profile sport is a colossal undertaking, encompassing a range of critical aspects:

* Volume of Athletes: With hundreds of fighters across multiple weight divisions, each with unique career trajectories, keeping track of every athlete's record, health status, contractual obligations, and ranking is a Herculean task.

* Dynamic Nature of Fighter Records: Fighter profiles are not static; they evolve with each bout. This includes updates in win-loss records, performance metrics, and medical suspensions. Accurate and real-time tracking of these changes is vital for the integrity of the sport.

* Fan Engagement and Transparency: Fans and analysts demand up-to-date information on fighter stats, upcoming bouts, and division rankings. Providing this information in a user-friendly manner enhances fan engagement and the sport's accessibility.

By creating an API that efficiently manages UFC fighter records and divisions, I am addressing these challenges head-on.

## R3 Why have you chosen this database system? What are the drawbacks compared to others?

Postgres frequently emerges as the top choice for Flask applications, largely owing to its robust library support through packages such as Psycopg2 and SQLAlchemy. These libraries facilitate strong scalability and ease the learning curve for database implementation. Additionally, the support for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) significantly contributes to Postgres's appeal. By employing ORM, which seamlessly maps the models feeding data into the database, developers find a reduced learning curve and a notable increase in scalability. This integration streamlines database interactions, making Postgres an efficient and user-friendly choice for Flask-based applications.

Before choosing a DBMS it's important to consider other alternatives and assess potential drawbacks, regardless of how strong the initial appeal is. SQLite is another common relational database management system that is discussed below.

### Primary Differences

***Server-Client Model vs Embedded Database:***

* Postgres: Operates on a server-client model. It's a robust, multi-user DBMS that runs on a server and can be accessed remotely by multiple clients.

* SQLite: An embedded database, it's integrated directly into the application. It's lightweight and intended for single-user applications or small-scale projects.

***Performance and Scalability:***

* Postgres: Known for its high performance, especially in handling complex queries, large databases, and multiple concurrent users. It's highly scalable, making it suitable for large-scale enterprise applications.

* SQLite: Optimized for lower resource usage and is efficient for smaller-scale applications. However, it might not perform well with high concurrency or complex queries.

***Feature Set:***

* Postgres: Offers a wide range of features including advanced indexing, full-text search, data warehousing, and support for multiple programming languages. It also supports JSON and NoSQL features, catering to a wider range of applications.

* SQLite: Provides a simpler feature set, focusing on basic SQL standards. While it supports most of the common SQL functionalities, it lacks some advanced features found in Postgres.

***Data Integrity and Security:***

* Postgres: Offers robust data integrity and security features. It includes support for ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, complex transactional capabilities, and strong security measures.

* SQLite: While reliable for data integrity, its simpler nature means it lacks some of the more sophisticated security and transactional features present in Postgres.

### Why Prefer Postgres?

***Enterprise-Grade Capabilities:*** For large-scale, multi-user, enterprise-level applications, Postgres is the preferred choice due to its scalability, performance, and rich feature set.

***Complex Data Handling:*** Postgres excels in handling complex queries, diverse data types, and large data volumes, making it ideal for complex applications like data analytics and warehousing.

***Extension and Language Support:*** With its extensibility and support for various programming languages, Postgres is highly adaptable to a wide range of applications and development needs.


### Conclusion
While SQLite is an excellent choice for simpler, embedded database needs, Postgres stands out for applications that demand higher performance, scalability, and a comprehensive set of features. Its ability to handle complex, enterprise-level applications with efficiency and reliability makes Postgres a preferred choice for this application.

## R4 Identify and discuss the key functionalities and benefits of an ORM


Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) offers a streamlined method for interacting with databases, bypassing the need for direct SQL query injection. By integrating ORM, users can harness the familiar paradigms of their programming language, such as creating classes, objects, instances, and methods. This approach aligns database operations with the language-specific structure, simplifying the process of data manipulation between the application and the database. This methodology not only saves time but also, once mastered, significantly simplifies coding for database interactions.

Benefits of using ORM include:

Language Consistency:

* ORM allows you to write database operations in the same programming language used in your application. For instance, in a Flask application, you can manage database interactions using Python objects instead of writing SQL queries. 

Leveraging Language Features:

* By using ORM, you gain access to advanced features and capabilities of the programming language in use. This includes taking advantage of language-specific libraries and packages, which can offer extended functionalities and tools that might not be readily available or as efficient when using raw SQL. For example, Pythonâ€™s libraries like SQLAlchemy provide powerful ORM capabilities, enhancing the efficiency and scalability of database operations.


Improved Code Maintainability and Readability:

* Code that uses ORM tends to be more readable and maintainable. It abstracts the complexities of raw SQL queries into more intuitive and high-level programming constructs. This abstraction makes the code easier to understand, modify, and maintain, especially for developers who might not be experts in SQL.

## R6 An ERD for the app
![ERD](/docs/T2A2%20ERD.png)

In the above ERD diagram, we see a visualization of the relations between the 3 models and their respective attributes. 'Divisions' and 'UFC_users' are independent entities with their own attributes. They do not have foreign keys linking to other tables but are referenced by the 'Fighters' table. 'Fighters' is dependent on both 'Divisions' and 'UFC_users', with foreign keys (division_id and user_id) linking to these tables. 
This  indicates that each fighter is associated with one division and one user, but each division and user can be associated with multiple fighters.

## R7 Detail any third-party servies your app will use
#### Flask
Flask is a lightweight and flexible micro web framework for Python, used for developing web applications. It is distinguished by its simplicity and capability to scale up to complexity. Flask provides the basics for web development, such as routing, request handling, and templates. It supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Flask is well-suited for small to medium-sized applications and services, and its minimalistic and modular design makes it easy for beginners to learn and use.

#### Psycopg2
Psycopg2 is a popular PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming language. It is implemented to communicate with PostgreSQL databases. Psycopg2 is known for its stability, scalability, and performance. It supports many of the features of PostgreSQL, such as large objects, notifications, and advanced data types. 

#### SQLAlchemy 
SQLAlchemy is a database toolkit for Python, providing a powerful and flexible ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system along with a database query language. It abstracts and streamlines database interactions by mapping Python classes to database tables, thereby allowing developers to interact with the database using Python code instead of writing raw SQL queries.

#### Bcrypt 
Bcrypt is a robust password hashing library in web development, primarily used for securing user passwords. By converting plain text passwords into a cryptographically secure hash and incorporating unique salts, Bcrypt effectively guards against common password vulnerabilities like rainbow table attacks and brute-force attempts. Its design intentionally slows down the hashing process, offering an additional layer of security. This library is crucial in user authentication systems for securely storing and verifying user passwords, enhancing overall application security.

#### JwtManager
JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a standard method for secure and efficient information exchange in web applications, particularly in token-based authentication systems. JWTs encode user credentials and other data into compact, URL-safe JSON objects, which can be digitally signed for integrity and authenticity. They facilitate stateless authentication, making them ideal for modern web and mobile applications with distributed architectures. JWTs are widely used for authorizing users and enabling access to protected resources, ensuring secure and streamlined communication between clients and servers.

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False, unique=True)
    description = db.Column(db.Text)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"<Division {self.name}>"
```
### Divisions Model
The divisions model handles the weght division in the UFC, there are 12 division each with their own weight limit. This model contains a unique id, name, and a description.
The Divisions model does not directly reference other models via foreign keys. However, it is referenced by the Fighters model. It uses a ```backref``` from the Fighters model, which allows for access to all fighters in a specific division. This is a one-to-many relationship, where one division can have multiple fighters.

```
class UFC_users(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(50), unique=True, nullable=False)
    password = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    role = db.Column(db.String(20), nullable=False)
```
### Users Model
The Users model contains the users for the platform, mainly to organise roles and relevenat privileges. E.g. Dana White is the only current admin and has full access to the platform, a Referee can modify the records and divisions but not delete. This model has a unique id, username, password, and role.
Similar to the Divisions model, UFC_users does not contain a direct reference to other models via foreign keys. However, it is referenced by the Fighters model.
A ```backref``` from the Fighters model is used here as well, enabling a one-to-many relationship where one user can be associated with multiple fighters.

```
class Fighters(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(255), nullable=False)
    age = db.Column(db.Integer)
    height = db.Column(db.Float)
    weight = db.Column(db.Float)

    division_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('divisions.id'), nullable=False)
    division = db.relationship('Divisions', backref=db.backref('fighters', lazy=True))

    record = db.Column(db.String(20))

    user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('ufc_users.id'), nullable=False)
    user = db.relationship('UFC_users', backref=db.backref('fighters', lazy=True))

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"<Fighter {self.name}>"

```
### Fighters Model
The Fighters model is the most important part of the database holding all fighter records and crucial information for the application to function correctly. This model has attributes like id, name, age, height, weight, record, and foreign keys division_id and user_id.
The division_id is a foreign key that links to the Divisions model. This creates a many-to-one relationship between Fighters and Divisions, where multiple fighters can belong to one division.
The user_id is another foreign key that links to the UFC_users model, establishing a many-to-one relationship between Fighters and UFC_users. This implies that each fighter is associated with a single user, but a user can be associated with multiple fighters.
The division relationship in the Fighters model maps to the Divisions model and the user relationship maps to the UFC_users model.

## R9 Discuss the database relations to be implemented

In the application's database structure, a one-to-many relationship is set between Divisions and Fighters, as well as between UFC_users and Fighters. This allows each division to handle numerous fighters. On the other hand, each fighter is exclusively associated with one division, ensuring clear classification. In a parallel structure, each user, encompassing roles like admin, referees, and spectators, can be responsible for or associated with multiple fighters, but each fighter is uniquely linked to a single user.

The databaseâ€™s integrity is maintained through the use of primary keys, which uniquely identify each record, and foreign keys, which establish links between tables and ensure consistency across related data. This setup not only guarantees the accuracy and reliability of the data but also simplifies complex queries, such as retrieving all fighters in a specific division or listing all fighters managed by a particular user. By leveraging these relational database principles, the application achieves a harmonious balance between comprehensive data organization and the flexibility to handle diverse user roles and fighter categories, laying a solid foundation for efficient data management and potential future scalability.


## R10 Describe the way tasks are allocated and tracked in your project
Tasks were tracked and allocated via discord standups, git commits, and the program [Linear](https://linear.app/matt-bryant-projects/project/ufc-webserver-api-8cc1a764fb1d/MAT).
Linear was used to hold tasks in a backlog and then each work session, I would find the necessary issues and bring them into the 'to do' section and deal with them that way. Milestones were also set to link issues to a broader task. By using Linear, I was able to carefully track sections of the code and planning process, and allocate the correct amount of time for each issue including some last minute fixes. Standups were used via discord to check in with the class and as a means of academic suport. Finally, Git was used for version control and to track changes via staging commits. This was crucial in the early stages of the code as I had quite some trouble modularizing and getting everything into Blueprints. Being able to roll back to previous versions was crucial in writing efficent code and the problem solving necessary.
